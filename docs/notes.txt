- Per U-net, weight the contour pixels? Don't need to do this in D-CAN because have separate contour map

- tf.image library for random image transformations

- Per U-Net video, can do image distortions for augmentation. See video here: https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/ at around 3:08

- Found these sizes so far: (696, 520), (1024, 1024), (320, 256), (360, 360), (256, 256)

- Use this example as an image with lots of overlapping nuclei: 5c6eb9a47852754d4e45eceb9a696c64c7cfe304afc5ea491cdfef11d55c17f3

- for overlap-tile, create an image of row_adj x col_adj with as many channels as there are 'tiles'. Have a companion array that tracks the centers of each of the tiles. Have the parts that don't overlap be a value like -1 or something different. In any slice across channels that has 2 or more values that's not -1, use the weighted average, weighted by the distance to their respective centers.
